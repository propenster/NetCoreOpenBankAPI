We built a bank API using C# and ASP.NET Core on my YouTube channel

## how to setup



* git clone https://github.com/propenster/NetCoreOpenBankAPI.git
* set up directory on your local machine
* replace connectionStrings value in appsettings.json with ConnectionString to your own Local/Remote SQL Server DB


* You may run "Add-Migration initial" on the Package Manager Console

* Run "Update-Database" on the Package Manager Console

* Also for Transactions, you wil also need to Register a new Account -> Your Bank's Settlement and put the accountNumber in the "NetCoreBankSettlementAccount": "2842017209" in appsettings.json
